# Grokking the Coding Interview Patterns for Coding Questions

## Patterns

**1. Sliding Window**
```
Given an array(or LinkedList) and asked to find or calculate something among all the contiguous subarrays(or sublists)
```

**2. Two Pointers**
```
Given sorted array(or LinkedList) and asked to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints. The set of elements could be a pair, a triplet or even a subarray.
```

**3. Fast and Slow Pointers**
```
This approach is useful for cyclic LinkedLists or arrays. By moving at different speeds (say, in a cyclic LinkedList), the algorithm proves that the two pointers are bound to meet. The fast pointer should catch the slow pointer once both the pointers are in a cyclic loop. 
```

**4. Merge Intervals**
```
This pattern describes an efficient technique to deal with overlapping intervals. In a lot of problems involving intervals, we either need to find overlapping intervals or merge intervals if they overlap.

Given two intervals (‘a’ and ‘b’), there will be six different ways the two intervals can relate to each other:

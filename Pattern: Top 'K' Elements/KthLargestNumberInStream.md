# Problem Statement

Design a class to efficiently find the Kth largest element in a stream of numbers.

The class should have the following two things:

1. The constructor of the class should accept an integer array containing initial numbers from the stream and an integer â€˜Kâ€™.
2. The class should expose a function add(int num) which will store the given number and return the Kth largest number.

## Example 1

Input: [3, 1, 5, 12, 2, 11], K = 4

1. Calling add(6) should return '5'.
2. Calling add(13) should return '6'.
3. Calling add(4) should still return '6'.

## Code:
```python3
from heapq import *

class KthLargestNumberInStream:
  minHeap = []

  def __init__(self, nums, k):
    self.k = k
    # add the numbers in the min heap
    for num in nums:
      self.add(num)

  def add(self, num):
    # add the new number in the min heap
    heappush(self.minHeap, num)

    # if heap has more than 'k' numbers, remove one number
    if len(self.minHeap) > self.k:
      heappop(self.minHeap)

    # return the 'Kth largest number
    return self.minHeap[0]
```

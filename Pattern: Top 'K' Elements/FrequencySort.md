# Problem Statement

Given a string, sort it based on the decreasing frequency of its characters.

## Example 1:

Input: "Programming"

Output: "rrggmmPiano"

Explanation: 'r', 'g', and 'm' appeared twice, so they need to appear before any other character.

## Example 2:

Input: "abcbab"

Output: "bbbaac"

Explanation: 'b' appeared three times, 'a' appeared twice, and 'c' appeared only once.

## Code:
```python3
from heapq import *

def sort_character_by_frequency(str):

  # find the frequency of each character
  charFrequencyMap = {}
  for char in str:
    charFrequencyMap[char] = charFrequencyMap.get(char, 0) + 1

  maxHeap = []
  # add all characters to the max heap
  for char, frequency in charFrequencyMap.items():
    heappush(maxHeap, (-frequency, char))

  # build a string, appending the most occurring characters first
  sortedString = []
  while maxHeap:
    frequency, char = heappop(maxHeap)
    for _ in range(-frequency):
      sortedString.append(char)

  return ''.join(sortedString)
```
